 L-Scale: A software hardware integrated project which uses Ultrasonic sensors to measure liquid levels and display information in flutter app

 ## L Scale variants:
  1) Fixed L-Scale: It will be mounted on a container/vessel/tank and will be sending the data to the mobile application via APIs
  2) Portable L-Scale: It can be mounted on a portable vessel, say bottle. It will be sending the data to the mobile application via bluetooth.

 ## Does it works?

 L-scale will consist of sensors like- ultrasonic sensor, so as to measure the level of liquid in the tank/vessel/bottle. On measuring the level, it is calculated that what percentage of the vessel is filled. This whole data is sent to thingspeak iot platform via nodemcu and from the cloud,  this real time data is sent to a mobile application, where the concerned person can see the level. Also, it sends alerts via app if the liquid goes down below a certain level.

 ## Why L-Scale ?

 1) The current liquid level mointoring systems are not portable
 2) Measurment of the liquid levels is very important for monitoring/controlling industrial processes.
 3) In process plants, the tanks generally contain imflammable and expensive liquids. So it is important to keep a tab on the level of the liquid in order to prevent overflow.
 4) App is cross platform
 5) UI is user friendly.

 ## Motive Behind L-Scale

 1) Using ultrasonic sensors for accurate measurement
 2) It's non contact use and suitabilty for various liquids
 3) Keeping a 24x7 check on liquid level
 4) Easy moitoring with the software

 ## Current features

 1) Live Liquid Level Tracking
 2) Automatic volume calculator
 3) Cross Platform App ( Available on Android, iOS, Desktop & Web)
 4) Beautiful User Interface
 5) Depth measuring and monitoring


 ## Business Idea

 ### Target Audience

 Industrial Usage – Can be used in Water Treatment Plants, Chemical Plants etc.
 Maintenance – Can be used in municipal services such as cleaning sewage
 Exploration – Can be used in mines, caves and ricer banks etc.
 Rescue - Can be used in Rescue operations in flooded regions

 ### Budget

 Fixed L-Scale will be cheaper due to lack of Bluetooth module and stable mounting
 Portable L-Scale will be an inexpensive option for Explorers, Field Engineers, Rescue Operators

 ### Publicity

 Many National/State/University Level programs have been launched in support of IOT projects as Atma Nirbhar Bharat currently. We plan to use this opportunity to get support from such programs.

 ### Usage and Feasability

 L-Scale is a Multi-Utility IOT Device with support app, created to record and display user’s measurements. It is a low cost device that contributes directly to several utility and industrial purposes.
